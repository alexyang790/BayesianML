# Classical Probability
Intuitive definition of probability
- set of events that can happen - *sample space*
- probability is then simply the size of desired subset relative to the size of the sample space

Issues: 
- considers discrete events 
- the principle of indifference 
	- in the absence of information events have equal probability
- doesn't require you to assign probabilities to events
- doesn't require you to know anything about the phenomena

# Subjective/Bayesian Probability 
- fundamentally based on the information available to you and your belief about the phenomena
